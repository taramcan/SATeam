    <p>Hello from the SATeam about <?= studentName?> for this follow data request!</p>

    <p>Would you please fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdsvKMfW81ofWYLFqveDtfedeVfH5TqrgopiVpts9O1LDED8A/viewform">this quick form</a> to help us get <b>a  snapshot about how <?= studentName?> has been progressing?</b></p>

    <p>This is our 6-week followup request so you should be reflecting specifically on changes/improvements or concerns that you have observed since the last SATeam meeting.  <b>And because this is a followup meeting you can skip the portion of the form that requests you complete the student interview by selecting "yes" to the third question.</b></p>

    <p>Please refer to the LA ID listed below where prompted.</p>
<table>
    <tr>
    <th>Student</th>
    <th>LAID</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><?= studentName?></td>
    <td><?= LAID?></td>
  </tr>
  </table>

  <p>We appreciate your participation <b> by 8am on <?= dueDate?> </b> so we can have feedback to provide to the parents at the upcoming follow up SATeam meeting.</p>
